	; we don't need/can't really use expmem info, because depending on
	; slave build options, we can have expmem at 0 and chipmem at $100000
	; or expmem at $80000 and chipmem at $0 but in the end CD32load sets
	; expmem to $80000 most of the time so why bother?? (or we can get that
	; from a game address register, e.g. no issue to "repatch" a patchlist since
	; we are called with the original arguments
	;
	; and the other data from slave header aren't very useful either
	;
	; what we need:
	; init routine (optional)
	; hook for each hookable call (optional)
_resload

_cdplay

_cdstop
	dc.l	0	; cd32load writes the address of the stop routine here
_cdstatus
	dc.l	0	; cd32load writes the address of the status routine here
				; 0: cd playing
				; 1: cd stopped playing

				; 3: error
_cdreplay
	dc.l	0	; cd32load writes the address of the play-if-play-ended routine here
_reserved

Working games tested so far on WinUAE CD32 standard confguration. Most work on real hardware but there can be exceptions. I'll try to test
them all on real hardware and will report status.
Be careful, as compatibility also depends a lot of the slave version used. Sometimes old slave works, new does not, and sometimes it the other way round.

(*)=tested on real HW (ATM a lot have been tested on real HW, but I don't have the exact list)


online version of the compat. list can be found here, more up to date than this one (well at least those reported working are definitely working):

and most of them use small files, which makes loading very slow and sometimes never ends on real hardware)

working, but problems:

- Puggsy (seems that sound is not working properly)
- Epic works, but seems to have severe keyboard handling issues (I didn't test past the name-entry screen)
- Alcatraz Works, sluggish during gameplay though (intro + menus are silky smooth). Keyboard issues. Maybe for the compatibility list?
- Prime Mover: gfx trashed
- Shadow Fighter (!AGA!) (with RESLOAD_TOP=0x80000) crashes after first round illegal????


starting up but crash along the way:

- Last Ninja 2: dots on screen, crashes after a while, probably bad patches/old slave
- Mega Lo Mania: crashes after intro illegal instruction in the woods
- Black Tiger: crash during game, retry nocache/nojoy
- Lion King: free zone: start 0014c1ac, end 00164c0c, RESLOAD_TOP=0x150000 CDBUFFER=0x150000 MASKINT6 starts but locks up just before game

non-working at all from the start:

- Falcon: empty filename passed
- F15 strike eagle: shows intro pic then TRAP xxx

List of AGA / 2MB requests:

- Fantasy Flyer AGA: needs kickemu: not possible not enough mem, a standard DOS patch would allow to run it
- Fatman The Caped Consumer AGA: not possible all memory is taken
- Mortal Kombat 2 (2MB slave): not possible all memory is taken (and 1MB slave works on emulation, not on real hardware) 
- Alien Breed 2 AGA: memory all taken

v0.47 (21-12-2019):

- fixed access mode on a file (worked, but you never know)
- reworked to be able to manage project with git

v0.46 (28-10-2019):

- added USEFASTMEM to enable set resident program in fastmem if available (before it was done if fastmem was found, which
  could bias vanilla CD32 tests)
- USEFASTMEM in conjunction with PRELOAD allows to allocate the file buffer in fast memory (wasn't done in earlier versions even if
  fastmem was available). This option allows to avoid too many CD loads and see if those loads are the reason of the game not working
- added MASKINT2 to catch unwanted level 2 interrupts during loading and block interrupts again
  (for games that change interrupts from within VBLANK interrupt, but where CDFREEZE is too extreme)
- added an important piece of information in the documentation: use JOYPAD=0 for slaves which already support CD32 joypad natively
- relaxed check for basemem vs cdbuffer (if basemem was exactly $1E0000 it failed, like for Rygar)
  
v0.45 (04-05-2019):

- removed useless Rob Northen CD & floppy & NVM routines, leaving only HD routine: smaller CD32load executable
- RNCD option removed (Rob Northen CD routine isn't available anymore)
- FAILSAFE option added to test when strange bugs appear during play (sets JOYPAD=0 and CDFREEZE)
- reverse-engineered Rob Northen HD routine partially. Look out for a future version with partial HD loading for A600s/A1200s
- added check to detect interrupt level 2 enabling when CD data load is running (so CDFREEZE has to be used)
- fixed error handling for games testing non-existent files

v0.44 (21-04-2019):

- read retry made more robust (crashed on Lemmings CD): Lemmings CD now works on the real machine
- added more details to error log
  
v0.43 (14-04-2019):

- improved CD data read / reduced retries/errors when switching from audio to data &
  reduce resume time in case of an error (still several seconds when there's a failure)
- Lemmings CD still doesn't work on the real machine... damn...

v0.42 (09-04-2019):

- added CD1X switch to set CD speed to 1 (not supported with RNCD)
- fixed nasty CD audio bug that prevented CD data read to work after audio had been played
- fixed kickemu games (broken since v0.41). Another World works. Other won't be useable
  because they load forever on real hardware (Panza Kick Boxing, Test Drive II)
- "red screen of death" works even if program is located in fastmem (Terrible Fire boards)
- added DEBUG switch to see colors during some specific operations
- fixed keyboard emulation (key release). Joypad states could be incorrect due to mixed registers
- disassembled and slightly reverse-engineered Psygore cd32 data loader, fixed the grinding issue in the code
  now it will be possible to add/fix stuff / alter assembly code at least.
- added source code for 2 new "cdslaves": Premiere & Silkworm (final)

v0.41:

- binned VBLHANDLER option which was a non-working attempt to add extra slave capability (now replaced CDSLAVE)
- removed NOAKIKOPOKE. No need to Akiko-poke. It's more toxic than doing nothing
- Added READDELAY (defaults to 200ms). Now retry delay is set by RETRYDELAY (also 200ms AKA 3000 units)
  (this feature allows to make some games work better by making sure that the CD accesses are not too close to each other)
  
v0.40:

- added ability to play CD audio while games are running
 (kudos to Toni Wilen for providing a hardware CD32 audio replay routine & great support)
- added source code for "cdslaves" done so far (Wonderdog, Gods, Marble Madness, Lemmings, Silkworm WIP)
- fixed: conditional PL_DATA in patchlist wrongly skipped
- fixed: joystick read routine when a joypad isn't connected
- improved: check if slave requirements (AGA) matches chiprev bits (now that CD32load can be run with A600+HD)

v0.34:

- fixed: gb_ChipRevBits0 wrong value stored
- fixed: wrong previous state memory in joypads
- improved: properly detect joystick / joypad connected (avoids that pressing 2nd button joystick resets the game)
- improved: if HD mode, detect used filesystem & block size. Exits if blocksize isn't 512 and filesystem is exotic like PFS, SFS
  (not perfect as it doesn't detect FFS mounted through uaehf.device yet)
- fixed: resload_GetFileSize/GetFileSizeDec now test D0 before returning (some games only tested CCR): Midnight Resistance works when
  files are RN-packed
- fixed: resload_GetCustom returns proper return code (in case some slave checks)

v0.33:

- "resload_PatchSeg" bugfix (last one I hope...): Pushover works
- support for actual chipset revision bits in resload_Control
- support for bplcon system value in resload_Control
- improved "resload_Relocate" support

v0.32:

- "resload_PatchSeg" support (with Relocate) & PL_GA patch command fixed
- fixed buggy resload_GetFileSizeDec: Flashback works

v0.31:

- improved "resload_Relocate" method: Xenon works now, without gfx glitches
- "resload_PatchSeg" support (with Relocate) & PL_GA patch command added: Moonstone works!
- documented the "reset with front buttons" option

v0.30:

- Now works from hard drive even if main hard drive device name is not DH0: but for instance DH1:
 (you still have to use DISKUNIT if your game data is located on unit 1)

v0.29:

- fixed CD buffer overlap which can result on random errors/"grinding" on real hardware (Thanks Toni!)
- merged Earok virtual mouse changes & documentation
- removed "blitz/LMB" for hard drive mode

v0.28:

- improved "red screen of death" display for AGA games (sometimes it just remained black on error). Thanks Galahad & Toni for that one
- set default debug key to an invalid value so slaves never trigger debugkey anymore (Project-X SE)
- fixed nasty A5 register change in ATN decruncher
- fixed ATN header overwrite when source!=dest
- fixed cd buffer address display shown at 0 when enabling PRETEND option

v0.27:

- Only useful CD/HD loader is loaded in memory (saves memory usage, useful when trying to run AGA games)
- New expert parameters FREEBUFFER and CDBUFFER2 used to workaround the lack of aligned free memory
  for cd buffer: Body Blows AGA now works (with something looking like "OS-flashes", only faster) !

v0.26:

- added activation of CUSTOMx=1 when buttons are pressed on startup
- added VBL interrupt redirect when JOYPAD is explicitly set on a 68000 machine (or NOVBRMOVE), allowing to remap
  joypad buttons to keyboard on most games on a 68000 (without the need of a VBR register)
- fixed a nasty bug when emulating TRAPV (Super OffRoad Racer works)
- Proper TPWM decrunch interface, now latest Turrican 3 slave runs (and possibly others using TPWM decruncher)
- Fixed FILECACHE/PRELOAD option with default CD loader (nasty lockups when used with diskimages)
- Fixed virtual keyboard / mouse options
- Better cd error handling
- Fixed cd buffer initialization: most AGA games previously locking up on real HW now work!

v0.25:

- removed the green delay screen for HRTMon: no more need to put breakpoints: HRTMon enters without doing anything special
  now that the custom registers banging was fixed in v0.24
- if a spurious level 2 interrupts occurs because of AKIKO, acknowledge and exit
- more complete handling of Akiko DMA when starting/stopping CDIO (thanks Toni)

v0.24:

- NOCACHE option removed (caches are now off by default, as a lot of games seem to need it to run)
- CPUCACHE option added to preserve caches (means that if you booted without caches, it won't turn it on)
- adapted sources & added makefile for vasm/vlink for native windows build (less than 1 hour work!)
- fixed custom registers banging so more games start OK on real hardware (thanks Toni)

v0.23:

- READDELAY now is able accept values > 0xFFFF
- Drive initialization is only performed if needed (may be unnecessary with PRELOAD)
- New MASKINT6 option used to avoid CD32 CIA-B interrupts on unhandled level 6 interrupts during game
  (allows to run Cool Spot, Global Gladiators, Putty Squad)
- If joypad=2 or 3, pressing RED+GREEN+YELLOW+BLUE+PLAY on joypad 2 resets the machine
- swapped BWD/FWD default mapping: now F1<=>BWD, F2<=>FWD
- HRTMon now useable from startup (D option) with some breakpoints tricks (HRTmon works with FREEZEKEY set
  without any tricks, but what's interesting in debugging often occurs at slave startup, like installing interrupts...)

v0.22:

- Fixed bug with PRELOAD and kickstart emulation
- Fixed crash when starting on IDE HD mode (A1200/A600), broken since v0.18

v0.21:

- added PRELOAD= option: this option preloads the passed file in memory BEFORE shutting down the OS: means that it will be loaded using AmigaDOS loader.
  Implies FILECACHE: you need 2MB of memory to use it in most cases
- NOCDFREEZE now still turns off level 2 interrupt instead of leaving all interrupts on
- Turns off AKIKO interrupt on level 2 interrupt (unless NOVBRMOVE is set): allows to run more games on real hardware
- Fixed Abort code 5 (DEBUG) in Project-X Special Edition (regression introduced v0.18 when initializing CIA stuff)
- Fixed chipmem memory detection with MaxLocMem instead of lame AllocMem call
- Works with CF IDE cards (successfully tested by tomcat666, who did not read the doc and did not know it wasn't supposed to work :)) Thanks!!
- resload_Examine() returns a valid handle on system directories: doesn't affect kickstart emulation, and startup will be faster

v0.20:

- added retries when error -5 is encountered on Psygore CD loader
- added FILECACHE option to speed up CD operations. Basically, if the game uses 1 megabyte and standard 901120 bytes diskfiles (or smaller files), this will work.
  (RNCD option turns that on since it cannot partially read files)
- added NB_READ_RETRIES for CD operations. Default is 3 retries.

v0.18 and before:

- did not care to log changes. Well, maybe I should have.
